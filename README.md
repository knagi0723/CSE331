# CSE331

## Class Descriptioin
In this course, students will survey fundamental data structures and many associated algorithms. Emphasis will be placed on matching the appropriate data structures and algorithms to application problems. Analysis of algorithms is crucial to making proper selections, so analysis is important in the course. This course assumes that students are already familiar with advanced programming techniques including the definition of classes, and use of dynamic memory and linked data structures, including lists and trees. Even though the treatment of algorithms and data structures is mostly conceptual, students are expected to be able to transform these algorithms and data structures into programs with proper approaches of software module development.
